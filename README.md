# Signup Form - The Odin Project

An exercise from [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/) where I built a signup form with a hero image and multi-column layout using HTML and CSS.

## What Is Built

A signup form with a two-column design: hero image on the left, registration form on the right with fields for name, email, phone, and password.
